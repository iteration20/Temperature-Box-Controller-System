# Temperature-Box-Controller-System
This is a academic project with my fellow mates under EEE-305, Control System Course.

Without control systems, Electrical and Electronic Engineering [EEE] is incomplete. A system may be programmed to provide certain outputs based on a variety of factors. Developing this Project,  w e incorporated a MCU based Automated Temperature Control Box in this project. The box will operate the entire system under specific circumstances. It disconnects the system from the main grid during high temperatures and functions simultaneously during low temperatures.
